        <p class="scetionSubTag text-small">The Tomb of Salabat Khan II is also commonly but mistakenly known as Chandbiwi's Mahel, Chand Bibi Palace or similar variations.
         It is a three-storey stone structure situated on the crest of a hill, 13 km from Ahmednagar city in the state of Maharashtra, India,The tomb is about 3080 feet above sea level on the top of a hill, 700–800 feet above the city, offering good views of the surrounding landscape and visible from almost anywhere in the city. It is believed that the structure was planned to be seven-storey but only three were built. The building is plain and having eight sided platform. By the simple contrivance of a stone terrace built about twelve feet high and 100 yards broad, the tomb seems to rise with considerable dignity from the centre of an octagon. The tomb has angular holes so has been given that rise so during sunset, sun light falls on it.</p>

        <p class="scetionSubTag text-small">Meherabad (meher meaning "friend" from Iranian "Mihir", ultimately from Sanskrit "Mithira"; abad meaning a prosperous settlement, or a flourishing colony) was originally an ashram established by Meher Baba near Arangaon village, India in 1923 about 9 kilometres (6 mi) south of Ahmednagar. It is now the site of Meher Baba's samadhi (shrine/tomb) as well as facilities and accommodations for pilgrims. Many buildings mostly associated with the earlier decades of Baba’s work, the graves of disciples, and a range of pilgrim accommodation and charitable establishments are also there. Many Baba-lovers work or live in the vicinity. There is also a free dispensary and school.</p>
